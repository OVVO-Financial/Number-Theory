# Number-Theory

Using the definition of the imaginary number (i) as a set of simultaneous real numbers, we are able to offer novel insights to the manipulation of the complex space **using only real numbers**.  We can [visualize](https://github.com/OVVO-Financial/Number-Theory/blob/master/Complex%20space.md) how trial division / Fermat's method operates on this space and increase efficiency by combining methods.

The [papers](https://github.com/OVVO-Financial/Number-Theory/tree/master/Number%20Theory%20Papers) provide details on how the complex space maps to real numbers and factor properties.

Please see the [Prime-Factorization branch](https://github.com/OVVO-Financial/Number-Theory/tree/Prime-Factorization) for factorization routines based on these insights.
