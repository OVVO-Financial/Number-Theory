# Number-Theory

Using the definition of the imaginary number (***i***) as a set of simultaneous real numbers, we are able to offer novel insights to the manipulation of the complex space **using only real numbers**.  We can [visualize how trial division / Fermat's method operates](https://github.com/OVVO-Financial/Number-Theory/blob/master/Complex%20space.md)  on this space and increase efficiency by combining methods.
This section presents the methods of factorization derived from the complex space insights detailed [here](https://github.com/OVVO-Financial/Number-Theory).

### Mapping
The simultaneous real numbers take the form [(***real - imaginary***),(***real + imaginary***)].  Some examples include:
* ***i*** →  [-1,1]
* ***2i*** →  [-2,2]
* ***-i*** →  [1,-1]
* ***(8+5i)*** →  [3,13]
* ***(-2-3i)*** →  [1,-5]


### Factorization
Please see the [Prime-Factorization branch](https://github.com/OVVO-Financial/Number-Theory/tree/Prime-Factorization) for factorization routines based on these insights.

* The method of [Naive Grouping](https://github.com/OVVO-Financial/Number-Theory/blob/Prime-Factorization/Naive%20Grouping.md)

* The method of [Complex Trial Multiplication](https://github.com/OVVO-Financial/Number-Theory/blob/Prime-Factorization/Complex%20Trial%20Multiplication.md)
