# Number-Theory

Using the definition of the imaginary number (***i***) as a set of simultaneous real numbers, we are able to offer novel insights to the manipulation of the complex space **using only real numbers**.  We can [visualize](https://github.com/OVVO-Financial/Number-Theory/blob/master/Complex%20space.md) how trial division / Fermat's method operates on this space and increase efficiency by combining methods.

#### Mapping
* ***i*** maps to real numbers [-1,1]
* ***2i*** maps to real numbers [-2,2]
* ***-i*** maps to real numbers [1,-1]
* ***(8+5i)*** maps to real numbers [3,13]
* ***(-2-3i)*** maps to real numbers [1,-5]

The [papers](https://github.com/OVVO-Financial/Number-Theory/tree/master/Number%20Theory%20Papers) provide details on how the complex space maps to real numbers, **how all complex operations are carried out with only real numbers**, and factor properties.

Please see the [Prime-Factorization branch](https://github.com/OVVO-Financial/Number-Theory/tree/Prime-Factorization) for factorization routines based on these insights.
