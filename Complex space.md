# Factors in the complex space

Below is the complex space associated with `n=309`.  Each triangle represents a complex number whose corresponding real numbers lie within the interval `[3,sqrt(n)]`.

Blue triangles are complex numbers whose real product is less than `n`.

Red triangles are complex numbers whose real product is greater than `n`.

The green triangle represents the complex number associated with the factors of `n=309`, `53+50i` which has corresponding real numbers `[3,103]`.

## Possible complex factors
All possible factors reside along the intersection of red & blue triangles.  We can highlight this strip in green.  The question becomes how do we best navigate this strip?

### Trial Division
Trial division diagonally checks all complex points as illuastrated below, where all of the highlighted complex numbers have a lower real number = 3.
