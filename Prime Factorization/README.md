# Prime Factorization Routines

This section presents the methods of factorization derived from the complex space insights detailed [here](https://github.com/OVVO-Financial/Number-Theory).

* The method of [Complex Trial Multiplication](https://github.com/OVVO-Financial/Number-Theory/blob/Prime-Factorization/Complex%20Trial%20Multiplication.md)

* The method of [Iterated Averages](https://github.com/OVVO-Financial/Number-Theory/blob/Prime-Factorization/Iterated%20Averages.md)

* The method of [Naive Grouping](https://github.com/OVVO-Financial/Number-Theory/blob/Prime-Factorization/Naive%20Grouping.md)

* The method of [Simultaneous Complex Factorization](https://github.com/OVVO-Financial/Number-Theory/blob/Prime-Factorization/Simultaneous%20Complex%20Factorization.md)
